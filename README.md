# TrialAndErrorVault
This is the home for the some of the things I've come across when managing infrastructure for my personal projects. The main goal here is to provide a place for some scripts and notes I can quickly refer to as I really dive deep into technologies without taking a vendor specific approach or relying on terraform to manage state right now.
